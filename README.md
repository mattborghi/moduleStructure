The "module" modeleStrucure contains a file which can be run using $ python Decoder/Main.py or $ python -m Decoder.Main.
Or, if we are in the Decoder subfolder $ python Main.py or $ python -m Main. 

A better idea is to import the module as a whole: import module from another folder, i.e., test folder with scripts.
