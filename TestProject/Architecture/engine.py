    """ Spatial 1D version of Dropout.
    This version performs the same function as Dropout, however it drops
    entire 1D feature maps instead of individual elements. If adjacent frames
    within feature maps are strongly correlated (as is normally the case in
    early convolution layers) then regular dropout will not regularize the
    activations and will otherwise just result in an effective learning rate
    decrease. In this case, SpatialDropout1D will help promote independence
    between feature maps and should be used instead.
    # Arguments
        rate: float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.
    # Input shape
        3D tensor with shape:
        `(samples, timesteps, channels)`
    # Output shape
        Same as input
